## Getting Started

Get a raspberry pi pico w 2 - wifi. Get a usb - micro-c cable and get thonny IDE.

![Raspberry Pi Pico](resources-for-readme/raspberry-pi-pico.jpg)

### Prerequisites

#### To Run it

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Thonny](https://thonny.org) - a micropython IDE

#### To Host

You can host it locally, or directly when it's connected via USB, but that implementation is not yet properly working fine.

It can be used to host a site 24/7. Also has a implementation for a 404 file not find, like most webservers. 

---

## Instructions

1. Get thony IDE and modify the network connectivity. 

2. Run the file setting up Thonny to run the code as a raspberry pi pico

- Make sure you have uploaded the files in the raspberry.

4. Run the script!

```
webserver.py
```

### File Structure

```
Web server in micro-python
 |-- webserver.py
 |-- default.html 
```

---

## Deployment

Here is a tutorial on how to deploy 


[Additional Information](#additional-information) for details on running the script continuously.

### How To Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your machine.
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name. You can use 'development' directly. 
4. Commit changes to the branch.
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
6. Push changes to your fork.
7. Open a Pull Request in my repository - Before start a conversation.

-For Development, use the development branch and then we can do a pull request to the main branch. use : git --help for swtiching ... e.g.:
```
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air webserver-raspberry-pico % git branch development
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air webserver-raspberry-pico % git branch        
  development
  * main
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air webserver-raspberry-pico % git checkout development
```
When git push for 'development':
```
git push --set-upstream origin development
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin development

git clone -b <branchname> <remote-repo-url>
```
