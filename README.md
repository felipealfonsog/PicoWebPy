![Raspberry Pi Pico](resources-for-readme/raspberry-pi-pico.jpg)

#### Prerequisites

#### To Run it

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Thonny](https://thonny.org) - a micropython IDE

#### To Host

You can host it locally, or directly when it's connected via USB, but that implementation is not yet properly working fine.

It can be used to host a site 24/7. Also has a implementation for a 404 file not find, like most webservers. 

---

#### Instructions

1. Get thony IDE and modify the network connectivity. 

2. Run the file setting up Thonny to run the code as a raspberry pi pico

- Make sure you have uploaded the files in the raspberry.

4. Run the script!

```
webserver.py
```

#### File Structure

```
Web server in micro-python
 |-- webserver.py
 |-- default.html 
```
