## Getting Started

Get a raspberry pi pico w 2 - wifi. Get a project usb - micro-c cable and get thonny.

![Raspberry Pi Pico](resources-for-readme/raspberry-pi-pico.jpg)

### Prerequisites

#### To Run it

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Thonny](https://thonny.org) - a micropython IDE

#### To Host

You can host it locally, or directly when it's connected via USB, but that implementation is not yet properly working fine.

It can be used to host a site 24/7. Also has a implementation for a 404 file not find, like most webservers. 

---

## Instructions

1. Get thony IDE and modify the network connectivity. 

2. Run the file setting up Thonny to run the code as a raspberry pi pico

- Make sure you have uploaded the files in the raspberry.

```

4. Adjustments you can make in `config`_

   - **search_
   - **delay** - Time 
     - Please be aware of
     - "recent", "popular", or "mixed"
   - **number_of
   - **run_continuously** - Set True if you want the bot to run continuously
     - Also set True if you will be deploying the script

5. Run the script!

```
python webserver.py
```

### File Structure

```
Web server in micro-python
 |-- webserver.py
 |-- default.html
 |-- 
 |--  
```

## Deployment

Here is a tutorial on how to deploy 


```
